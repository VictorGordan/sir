# sir

This is a university project meant to simulate the spread of diseases using an SIR Cellular Automata model.

Capabilities:
- large cell fields (by default 250,000 cells)
- three types of cells: susceptible, infectious, resistant
- takes into account population density for infection chances
- can modify multiple variables such as the length of the infectious and resistance periods, initial infections, base infection chance, and more
- can switch out the population density map
